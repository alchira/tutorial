title: 4.0 Custom Reserved Tags
---

Alchira reserves a small set of custom tags and placeholders that make it possible to declare, reuse, and inject styles and snippets directly in markup. These tags are transformed away at compile time, so they never reach the browser.

## Declaration Tags (paired tags)

When a symbolic class (symlink) appears as an attribute on these special tags, the content between the opening and closing tags is bound to that symlink. During compilation, the tags themselves are collapsed and only the generated CSS and HTML remain.

```html 
<style local$-class>
  /* CSS snippet bound to local$class */
</style>

<sketch local$--class>
  <!-- Snippet bound to local$class -->
</sketch>

<sketch
  attribute-1="attr-value-1"
  attribute-2="attr-value-2"
  local$class="
    ~ local$-class local$--class;
    + $class-1 $$class-2 $class-3;
    property-1: value-1;
    property-2: value-2;
    property-3: value-3;
  "
>
  Template
</sketch>
```

### `<style> ... </style>`

- Uses the standard HTML `<style>` tag, but when a symlink is present on the tag, its content becomes a dependent CSS snippet of that symlink.
- Declared with a symlink where `-` immediately follows the final `$`, for example: `style$-class-name`.
- The snippet is processed as CSS and merged into the compiled stylesheet.

### `<sketch> ... </sketch>`

- Declares component-level styles and generates a corresponding preview template.
- The attribute-value for a symlink defines its composition and rules.
- The inner HTML is used as a live preview template in the sketchpad:
  - `style` attributes are passed to the sketchpad body.
  - Other attributes are passed directly to the component template.


## Replacement Placeholders

Self-closing tags and reserved HTML comments act as insertion points where compiled styles and sketch snippets are injected.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta
    name="viewport"
    content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
  />
  <!-- style -->
</head>

<body
  data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover"
  class="=bg$pattern-checkerboard =$custom-pattern"
  _$custom-pattern="
    --pattern-checker-bg1: #456734;
    --pattern-checker-bg2: #2bb43d;
    --pattern-checker-size: var(---delta-block-lg);
  "
>
  <sketch amorphous$--container>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"></svg>
  </sketch>

  <sketch
    data-glass-type="liquid"
    amorphous$$$container="
      ~ amorphous$--container;
      &::after {
        filter: url(#\#glass-distortion);
      }
    "
  >
    Template
  </sketch>

  <div
    id="#scoped-id"
    data-glass-type="liquid"
    class="~amorphous$$$container"
  > Content </div>

  <!-- sketch -->
</body>
</html>
```

### `<sketch />` / `<!-- sketch -->`

- Placeholder used to deploy associated partial sketch snippets.

### `<style />` / `<!-- style -->`

- Marks where the compiled stylesheet block should be embedded inside targeted files.

> By using reserved tags and placeholders, Alchira transforms HTML into a high-level declaration layer. It enables you to define styles and components directly on the structure, which the compiler then distills into standard, browser-ready HTML and CSS. This approach keeps your source code clean and unified while granting precise control over the final CSS output.
